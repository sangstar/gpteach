# GPTeach: Create Q&A's for any topic for studying or data generation

A project I'm working on that will aim to create Q&A's for a topic of your choice using the Wikipedia API and GPT, that can be used for study guides or for data to fine-tune an autoregressive model. Uses Wikipedia articles as a resource to prevent inaccuracies/hallucinations. Work in progress.
